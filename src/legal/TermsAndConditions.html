            MealOps operates an online marketplace and connection platform to (a) broker the exchange of goods and
            services among you and other consumers, restaurants and other businesses ("<strong
                class="font-bold">Merchants</strong>"), and independent third-party contractors who provide delivery
            and/or other services ("<strong class="font-bold">Contractors</strong>"); and (b) provide you with access to
            information on the Services. MealOps’s Technology permits consumers to place orders for food and/or other
            goods from Merchants, either for delivery or pickup, and/or request services from Merchants. If a delivery
            order is made, MealOps uses the Technology to notify Contractors (or, for certain orders, Merchants) that a
            delivery opportunity is available and to facilitate completion of the delivery to the consumer. If a pickup
            order is made, MealOps uses the Technology to communicate with the consumer regarding the availability of
            the order for pickup. MealOps is not a merchant, retailer, restaurant, grocer, delivery service, or food
            preparation business (except as otherwise specified in Section 6 below).

            restaurant, grocer, pharmacy, chemist, delivery service, or food preparation business, and has no

            responsible for Merchants’ food preparation or product offerings, food or product handling, or the safety of
            the food or other products, or whether the photographs, images, videos, menu or product listings, catalog,
            item descriptions, or other menu, product, or catalog information (including nutrition, ingredient, and/or
            allergen information) displayed through the Services accurately reflect the goods and services sold by

            applicable laws or regulations. You also acknowledge and agree that menu, product, or catalog listings,
            descriptions, or other information (including videos, photographs, or images, or nutrition, ingredient,

            Merchant and/or may have been generated or enhanced with the assistance of artificial intelligence. MealOps
            has no responsibility or liability for acts or omissions by any Merchant or Contractor. You agree that the
            goods that you purchase will be prepared by the Merchant you have selected, that title to the goods passes
            from the Merchant to you at the Merchant’s location, and that, for delivery orders, the Contractor and/or
            Merchant will be directed by your instructions to transport the products to your designated delivery
            location. You agree that neither the Contractor nor MealOps holds title to or acquires any ownership
            interest in any goods that you order through the Services. You must not do anything which seeks to create an

            efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and
            MealOps therefore agree that, before either you or MealOps demands arbitration against the other, we will
            personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve informally
            any claim covered by this mutual Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may
            participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. The party initiating
            the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal
            dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such notice,
            unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. To notify MealOps that you intend to initiate an
            informal dispute resolution conference, email <a href="mailto:mealops.help@gmail.com"
                class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">mealops.help@gmail.com</a>, providing your name, telephone number

            description of your claim. In the interval between the party receiving such notice and the informal dispute
            resolution conference, the parties shall be free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims.
            Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before
            commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
            parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.

                arbitration proceeding, that party must send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying
                completion of the informal dispute resolution conference pursuant to paragraph 13(b). If this notice is

                Inc. must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the party
                seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those
                claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in
                controversy, enumerated in United States Dollars (any request for injunctive relief or attorneys’ fees
                shall not count toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks
                the payment of money); and (4) the signature of the party seeking arbitration. The fees that shall apply
                to arbitrations administered by ADR Services, Inc. are set forth on ADR Services, Inc.’s website,

                all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by ADR Services, Inc.’s Fee Schedule

                case opening fees (if any) that exceeds the filing fee to file the case in a court of competent
                jurisdiction embracing the location of the arbitration. If ADR Services, Inc. is not available to
                arbitrate, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the
                arbitration conducted by telephone, video conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the
                county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. To the extent there is a dispute over
                which arbitration provider shall administer the arbitration, only a court (and not an arbitrator or
                arbitration administrator) can resolve that dispute, and the arbitration shall be stayed until the court
                resolves that dispute. The parties agree that all of the arbitration proceedings, including any
                discovery, hearings, and rulings, shall be confidential to the fullest extent permitted by law. If at
                any time the arbitrator or arbitration administrator fails to enforce the terms of this Arbitration
                Agreement, either party may seek to enjoin the arbitration proceeding in court, and the arbitration
                shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of that proceeding.</li>
